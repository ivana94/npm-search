### what is this?

Many times I've found myself wanting to use an NPM package, but couldn't figure out how to use it because of poor documentation or lack of experience.

This project aimed at trying to find specific files that use an NPM package of your choice, and hopefully the file will demonstrate at least one way to use that NPM package!

So let's say you want to see how to use `normalize.css`. You can go to this site, enter `normalize.css` into the input field, and you'll see a list of files that use `normalize.css`. Then you can view the files and hopefully one of them gives you a nice example of how to use `normalize.css`!
